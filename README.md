### Elevator pitch

Ever struggled with the age-old question, **'What do you want to watch tonight?'** With _Watch with Me!_ , youâ€™ll never have to ask this again. This simple app lets anyone add movie titles, vote on what youâ€™d like to watch, and instantly find the perfect match that everyone agrees on. Itâ€™s quick, fun, and takes the stress out of movie night decisions.

### Design

Here you can rate the movies pulled in through the API or added by users.You can also link with a different user and see what movie you both would like to watch

### Key features

- Login with your user
- Add and vote on movie titles
- Have the app return a movie everyone likes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. 5 HTML pages. One for login, one to sign up, one to rate movies, one to add movies, one to match with other users. Hyperlinks to choice page.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, adding movies, display other users votes, backend endpoint calls.
- **React** - Single page section that displays recent shared liked movies in responce to users actions.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - retrieving movies
  - submitting votes
  - retrieving vote status
  - add movies from [themovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list)
- **DB/Login** - Store users, choices, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't vote unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user votes, their votes are broadcast to all other users.
