### Elevator pitch

Ever struggled with the age-old question, __'What do you want to watch tonight?'__ With  *Watch with Me!* , youâ€™ll never have to ask this again. This simple app lets anyone add movie titles, vote on what youâ€™d like to watch, and instantly find the perfect match that everyone agrees on. Itâ€™s quick, fun, and takes the stress out of movie night decisions.

### Design

This is where you will be able to login and will be the home page

Here you can rate the movies pulled in through the API or added by users.You can also link with a different user and see what movie you both would like to watch

### Key features

- Login with your user
- Add and vote on movie titles
- Have the app return a movie everyone likes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. 5 HTML pages. One for login, one to sign up, one to rate movies, one to add movies, one to match with other users. Hyperlinks to choice page.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, adding movies, display other users votes, backend endpoint calls.
- **React** - Single page section that displays recent shared liked movies in responce to users actions.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - retrieving movies
  - submitting votes
  - retrieving vote status
  - add movies from [themovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list)
- **DB/Login** - Store users, choices, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't vote unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user votes, their votes are broadcast to all other users.
